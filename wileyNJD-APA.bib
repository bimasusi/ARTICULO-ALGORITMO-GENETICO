@article{Yang,
	abstract = {Background
Air pollutants are suggested to be related to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since several high quality papers on air pollutants and T2D have been published beyond the last reviews, an extended systematic review is highly warranted. We review epidemiological studies to quantify the association between air pollutants and T2D, and to answer if diabetes patients are more vulnerable to air pollutants.
Methods
We systematically reviewed the databases of PubMed and Web of Science based on the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). We calculated odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the strength of the associations between air pollutants [e.g., particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter with diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] and T2D. We evaluated the quality and risk of bias of the included studies and graded the credibility of the pooled evidence using several recommended tools. We also performed sensitivity analysis, meta-regression analysis, and publication bias test.
Results
Out of 716 articles identified, 86 were used for this review and meta-analysis. Meta-analyses showed significant associations of PM2.5 with T2D incidence (11 studies; HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04--1.17 per 10 μg/m3 increment; I2 = 74.4%) and prevalence (11 studies; OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.04--1.12 per 10 μg/m3 increment; I2 = 84.3%), of PM10 with T2D prevalence (6 studies; OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03--1.17 per 10 μg/m3 increment; I2 = 89.5%) and incidence (6 studies; HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00--1.22 per μg/m3 increment; I2 = 70.6%), and of NO2 with T2D prevalence (11 studies; OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.04--1.11 per 10 μg/m3 increment; I2 = 91.1%). The majority of studies on glucose-homoeostasis markers also showed increased risks with higher air pollutants levels, but the studies were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. Overall, patients with diabetes might be more vulnerable to PM.
Conclusions
Recent publications strengthened the evidence for adverse effects of ambient air pollutants exposure (especially for PM) on T2D and that diabetic patients might be more vulnerable to air pollutants exposure.},

@article{Keplac,
	abstract = { There is a growing number of studies on the association between ambient air pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but their results have been inconsistent. Consequently, a comprehensive review of this research area is needed. There was a wide variability in studied pregnancy outcomes, observed gestational windows of exposure, observed ambient air pollutants, applied exposure assessment methods and statistical analysis methods Gestational duration, preterm birth, (low) birth weight, and small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction were most commonly investigated pregnancy outcomes. Gestational windows of exposure typically included were whole pregnancy period, 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester, first and last gestational months. Preterm birth was the outcome most extensively studied across various gestational windows, especially at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy. Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide were the most commonly used markers of ambient air pollution. Continuous monitoring data were frequently combined with spatially more precisely modelled estimates of exposure. Exposure to particulate matter and ozone over the entire pregnancy was significantly associated with higher risk for preterm birth: the pooled effect estimates were 1.09 (1.03--1.16) per 10 μg/m3 increase in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm or less (PM10),1.24 (1.08--1.41) per 10 μg/m3 increase in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM2.5), and 1.03 (1.01--1.04) per 10 ppb increase in ozone. For pregnancy outcomes other than PTB, ranges of observed effect estimates were reported due to smaller number of studies included in each gestational window of exposure. Further research is needed to link the routine pregnancy outcome data with spatially and temporally resolved ambient air pollution data, while adjusting for commonly defined confounders. Methods for assessing exposure to mixtures of pollutants, indoor air pollution exposure, and various other environmental exposures, need to be developed.},

@article{Laurent,
	abstract = {Background
Low birth weight (LBW, <2500g) has been associated with exposure to air pollution, but it is still unclear which sources or components of air pollution might be in play. The association between ultrafine particles and LBW has never been studied.
Objectives
To study the relationships between LBW in term born infants and exposure to particles by size fraction, source and chemical composition, and complementary components of air pollution in Los Angeles County (California, USA) over the period 2001--2008.
Methods
Birth certificates (n=960,945) were geocoded to maternal residence. Primary particulate matter (PM) concentrations by source and composition were modeled. Measured fine PM, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations were interpolated using empirical Bayesian kriging. Traffic indices were estimated. Associations between LBW and air pollution metrics were examined using generalized additive models, adjusting for maternal age, parity, race/ethnicity, education, neighborhood income, gestational age and infant sex.
Results
Increased LBW risks were associated with the mass of primary fine and ultrafine PM, with several major sources (especially gasoline, wood burning and commercial meat cooking) of primary PM, and chemical species in primary PM (elemental and organic carbon, potassium, iron, chromium, nickel, and titanium but not lead or arsenic). Increased LBW risks were also associated with total fine PM mass, nitrogen dioxide and local traffic indices (especially within 50m from home), but not with ozone. Stronger associations were observed in infants born to women with low socioeconomic status, chronic hypertension, diabetes and a high body mass index.
Conclusions
This study supports previously reported associations between traffic-related pollutants and LBW and suggests other pollution sources and components, including ultrafine particles, as possible risk factors.},

@article{Xiao,
	abstract = {Few studies have estimated effects of maternal PM2.5 exposure on birth outcomes in China due to the lack of historical air pollution data.
Objectives
We estimated the associations between maternal PM2.5 exposure and birth outcomes using gap-filled satellite estimates in Shanghai, China.
Methods
We obtained birth registration records of 132,783 singleton live births during 2011--2014 in Shanghai. PM2.5 exposures were assessed from satellite-derived estimates or central-site measurements. Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate associations with term birth weight and term low birth weight (LBW), respectively. Logistic and discrete-time survival models were used to estimate associations with preterm birth. Effect modification by maternal age and parental education levels was investigated.
Results
A 10 μg/m3 increase in gap-filled satellite-based whole-pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was associated with a −12.85 g (95\% CI: −18.44, −7.27) change in term birth weight, increased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.27, 95\% CI: 1.20, 1.36), and increased risk of term LBW (OR 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.06, 1.41). Sensitivity analyses during 2013--2014, when ground PM2.5 measurements were available, showed that the health associations using gap-filled satellite PM2.5 concentrations were higher than those obtained using satellite PM2.5 concentrations without accounting for missingness. The health associations using gap-filled satellite PM2.5 had similar magnitudes to those using central-site measurements, but with narrower confidence intervals.
Conclusions
The magnitude of associations between maternal PM2.5 exposure and adverse birth outcomes in Shanghai was higher than previous findings. One reason could be reduced exposure error of the gap-filled high-resolution satellite PM2.5 estimates.},

Air pollutants are hypothesized to exert their effects via impaired endothelial function, elevated systemic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, all of which are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we review epidemiological studies aimed at answering whether diabetes patients are more vulnerable to ambient (outdoor) air pollution exposure and whether air pollution is associated with diabetes development or other predisposing conditions for T2D. Current evidence suggests an association between air pollution exposure and T2D, but more critical analysis is warranted. Understanding the associations between air pollution exposure and the development of T2D is critical in our efforts to control sources of air pollution and their impact on the disease.},

@article{Lim,
	abstract = {Objective
Recent mechanistic and epidemiological evidence implicates air pollution as a potential risk factor for diabetes; however, mortality risks have not been evaluated in a large US cohort assessing exposures to multiple pollutants with detailed consideration of personal risk factors for diabetes.
Research design and methods
We assessed the effects of long-term ambient air pollution exposures on diabetes mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a cohort of approximately a half million subjects across the contiguous U.S. The cohort, with a follow-up period between 1995 and 2011, was linked to residential census tract estimates for annual mean concentration levels of PM2.5, NO2, and O3. Associations between the air pollutants and the risk of diabetes mortality (N = 3598) were evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for both individual-level and census-level contextual covariates.
Results
Diabetes mortality was significantly associated with increasing levels of both PM2.5 (HR = 1.19; 95\% CI: 1.03--1.39 per 10 μg/m3) and NO2 (HR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01--1.18 per 10 ppb). The strength of the relationship was robust to alternate exposure assessments and model specifications. We also observed significant effect modification, with elevated mortality risks observed among those with higher BMI and lower levels of fruit consumption.
Conclusions
We found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2, but not O3, is related to increased risk of diabetes mortality in the U.S, with attenuation of adverse effects by lower BMI and higher fruit consumption, suggesting that air pollution is involved in the etiology and/or control of diabetes.},

@article{Davis2006,
	abstract = {This article considers the problem of modeling a class of nonstationary time series using piecewise autoregressive (AR) processes. The number and locations of the piecewise AR segments, as well as the orders of the respective AR processes, are assumed unknown. The minimum description length principle is applied to compare various segmented AR fits to the data. The goal is to find the ``best'' combination of the number of segments, the lengths of the segments, and the orders of the piecewise AR processes. Such a ``best'' combination is implicitly defined as the optimizer of an objective function, and a genetic algorithm is implemented to solve this difficult optimization problem. Numerical results from simulation experiments and real data analyses show that the procedure has excellent empirical properties. The segmentation of multivariate time series is also considered. Assuming that the true underlying model is a segmented autoregression, this procedure is shown to be consistent for estimating the location of...},

@article{Li2012,
	abstract = {AbstractThis paper studies genetic algorithms as a means of estimating the number of changepoints and their locations in a climatic time series. Such methods bypass classic subsegmentation algorithms, which sometimes yield suboptimal conclusions. Minimum description length techniques are introduced. These techniques require optimizing an objective function over all possible changepoint numbers and location times. The general objective functions allow for correlated data, reference station aspects, and/or nonnormal marginal distributions, all common features of climate time series. As an exhaustive evaluation of all changepoint configurations is not possible, the optimization is accomplished via a genetic algorithm that randomly walks through a subset of good models in an intelligent manner. The methods are applied in the analysis of 173 yr of annual precipitation measurements from New Bedford, Massachusetts, and the North Atlantic basin tropical cyclone record.},
